    # ---------------------------------------
    # As a library, we use lower version bounds
    # when specifying its dependencies. This lets
    # other programs find a compatible set of 
    # dependency versions.
    #
    # We can optionally pin to specific versions or
    # limit the upper bound when there's a good reason;
    # but the default is to assume all greater versions
    # probably work until proven otherwise.
    #
    # The following link provides good background:
    # https://iscinumpy.dev/post/bound-version-constraints/
    #
    # When we develop this library, and when we distribute it as
    # a standalone binary, we'll use specific versions
    # that are pinned in requirements.txt.
    # But the requirements for a library are specified here
    # and are looser.

    # or minor otherwise).
